# Superstore ales Analysis (SQL Project)

## Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive **sales data analysis** on a `superstore` dataset using **MySQL**. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, aggregation, ranking, and trend analysis. The goal is to derive actionable insights related to **sales, profit, customers, products, and regions**.

## Dataset

* **Dataset :** `Superstore_Orders_Data.xlsx`
* **Database:** `sales_analysis`
* **Source:** Internal store sales data (Excel imported into MySQL)
* **Key Columns:**

  * `Order ID`
  * `Customer ID`
  * `Customer Name`
  * `Product Name`
  * `Category`, `Sub-Category`
  * `Region`
  * `Segment`
  * `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Profit`, `Discount`

## Features & Analysis Performed

1. **Database & Table Setup**

   * Created `sales_analysis` database.
   * Cleaned and reset the `Row ID` column for sequential indexing.

2. **Data Quality Checks**

   * Checked for **null values** in key columns (`Sales`, `Row ID`, etc.).
   * Identified **duplicate `Order ID`s**.
   * Checked distinct values for `Category`, `Region`, `Segment`, and `Ship Mode`.

3. **Aggregate Metrics**

   * **Total Sales, Quantity, and Profit** by Category, Region, Segment, and Ship Mode.
   * **Yearly** and **monthly** sales trends.
   * **Profit margin** by product category.

4. **Product Analysis**

   * Top and bottom 10 products by **Sales** and **Profit**.
   * Products generating **negative profit** (loss-making products).
   * Top products by **Region** (sales and profit).

5. **Customer Insights**

   * Customers with **only one purchase**.
   * Segment-wise purchasing trends.

6. **Trend Analysis**

   * Sales growth rate between **current month** and **previous month**.
   * **Shipping mode usage trend** analysis.

## SQL Concepts Used

* **Basic Queries:** `SELECT`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `ROUND`, `DISTINCT`
* **Table Alteration:** `ALTER TABLE` to drop/add columns
* **Conditional Aggregation:** `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
* **Date Functions:** `YEAR()`, `MONTHNAME()`, `STR_TO_DATE()`, `DATE_FORMAT()`
* **Ranking & Window Functions:** `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `OVER()`
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** `WITH` statements for trend analysis
* **Sorting & Filtering:** `ORDER BY`, conditional filtering with `WHERE` and `HAVING`

## How to Use

1. Import the `Superstore_Orders_Data.xlsx` dataset into MySQL Workbench.
2. Execute the SQL scripts in the following order:

   * Database creation and table setup.
   * Data cleaning and null/duplicate checks.
   * Aggregation, ranking, and trend analyses.
3. Explore the queries to generate insights on **sales, profits, customers, and product performance**.

## Key Insights (Examples)

* Highest sales are generated by **Technology products** in the **East Region**.
* Top profitable products vary by region, highlighting **regional preferences**.
* Certain products consistently generate negative profit, indicating potential issues with pricing or discounts.
* Customers with a single purchase represent **opportunities for retention campaigns**.
* Shipping trends reveal the most frequently used **Ship Mode**, which can optimize logistics.
